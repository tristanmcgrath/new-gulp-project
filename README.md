# new-gulp-project
A template for projects built with Gulp

This template may be used for creating new projects with Gulp. Here is a summary of automated functions when default `gulp` is ran:
*JS: transpile, concatenate to single file, then minify
*Sass: transpile to CSS, concatenate to single file, add vendor prefixes, then minify
*Watch: run above appropriate tasks whenever file changes are saved, auto load updated page in Chrome browser

To make use of this Gulp template, clone the repository and then download the dev-dependencies required for 
gulpfile.js by running `npm install` in the project directory (must first install `node.js` and `npm`).
